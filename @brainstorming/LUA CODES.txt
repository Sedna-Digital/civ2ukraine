-- IF FORTIFIED, CANT MOVE WHEN UNFORTIFYING
-- =========================================
-- the idea is that SAM, logistic units etc need to pack and unpack. A unit going out of fortification state should need a turn. Also, if applied to the whole scenario, it would make fortifying a more important decision. It would also remove the opportunity to attack by surprise when the ennemy makes a blunder move if they cannot unfortify and attack right away. That means keeping a unit non fortified is a strategic decision too

discreteEvents.onActivateUnit(function(unit,source,repeatMove)
    if gen.isFortified(unit) then
        unit.moveSpent = 255
    end
end)

WONDERS AND BUILDINGS

They're hard coded, and so will always take effect*. However, if something can be achieved by Lua (and a lot of things can), you can condition that effect on whether a city/tribe has a certain improvement or wonder, and thereby enhance the effect.

*Lua/TOTPP can change a couple things, like the defense bonus for city walls.

COMBAT
Stopping a fight before unit is destroyed?
Yes, that can be changed in combatSettings.lua in the template now. (Prof Garfield)

If you want to stop units from healing each turn, gen.setMoved can be used to make sure that units that skip their turn still do not get their automatic heal if they don't qualify for it.

I believe all this is possible. I think we can control everything about combat now (even letting both units survive). The combatSettings.lua and registerCombatModifiers.lua files in the template are relevant here.

UPGRADE + CAMO
Unit combat stats can be easily modified if certain conditions are met, including techs acquired. The customComsic module could let you change movement allowances, and the unitData module could let you keep track of which units are or are not camouflaged.

In the case of camouflage, I'd use Lua to replace units with ones of a different type, so the player can more easily tell the difference.

SAM
Yes, this can be done. Combat stats can be changed based on if a SAM is nearby, or an 'onEnterTile' event might do something to a wandering aircraft.

- support units which allows for replenishment of units within X tiles
Yes.

You could make a unit for the human player that could change the terrain of an adjacent square to a "bridge", but I'd recommend making that sort of thing event driven instead. If a player's troops hold both sides of the river, there could be an option to build a bridge after a few turns. Then the AI could get it for free if conditions are met. Definitely don't try to use irrigation/mining/domain 3 units; the AI won't do it right.
