# civ2ukraine

v0.001

Hello,

I decided to make a github repository of my Civ2 scenario project for several reasons

- I plan on learning more advanced coding, so it just made sense
- It could encourage people to collaborate
- It will be simpler for people to download the latest version
- It might be easier to track versions down the line

WIP

Thanks for your interest :)
